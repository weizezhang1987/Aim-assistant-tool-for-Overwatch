THIS IS NOT A MALWARE
Warning: For research purpose only. Do not use it for competitive gameplay. The source code and the executable are all in the repo. Use it at your own risk.
This is not a hack. It may not work in the way you wanted. This program does not hack into memory to retreive additional information. It uses computer vision algorithms to recognize objects, thus no wall hack is provided.
To use this, put everything into one single directory and run ConsoleApplication1.exe. Overwatch must be in windowed mode.
